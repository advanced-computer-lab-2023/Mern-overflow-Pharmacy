## Code Style 📜 

The code style used is `eslint` and [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/). The code style is enforced using `pre-commit` hooks

To use the code style we follow, run these commands

Install pre-commit package by running

```bash
> pip install pre-commit
```

Once installed, run the following for a one-time setup

```bash
> pre-commit install
```

You will then need to run the following command each time before your next commit attempt

```javascript
> npx prettier . --write
```
